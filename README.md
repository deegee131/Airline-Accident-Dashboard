The Airline Accident Dashboard is a comprehensive data visualization tool that provides detailed insights into historical airline accidents.
Users can explore and examine data on aircraft accidents using this interactive dashboard, which helps them better understand accident trends and patterns.
By utilizing data-driven insights, the main goal of this project is to increase aviation safety. The dashboard enables aviation experts, researchers, and enthusiasts to glean useful information from the sizable archive of historical accident data by offering an aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly interface.
I used only Microsoft Excel for this dashboard. Firstly, after downloading the data from https://data.world/hhaveliw/airline-accidents.
The following are the steps I took to completing the dashboard: Data Cleaning, Data Processing, Data Analysis and then Data Visualization.
